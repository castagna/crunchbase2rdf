  CrunchBase 2 RDF
  ================

  CrunchBase is the free database of technology companies, people, and 
  investors that anyone can edit: http://www.crunchbase.com/
  
  CrunchBase2RDF is a small Java program which crawls and converts the
  CrunchBase data into RDF. This is currently incomplete and onoing, so
  if you are interested in having the complete CrunchBase data in RDF
  you can help with the modeling and with adding RDFExtractors.
